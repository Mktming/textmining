"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic So tell me how do massive companies in Asia with a 99% Asian  staff contingency remain far more innovative than western and Middle East counterparts? The answer is ability..."
"@Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @TashmiaI @VirginAtlantic Its a good initiative but not necessarily the complete truth, would be nice if it was."
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic And it is this generalistic thinking, misleading media and consistent focus on driving the narrative on the difference between male, female, black, white... Eventually when you see behind the misconstrued narrative it is inevitable that ability drive success, growth &amp; innovation"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Never said that... Diversity or lack thereof should have no effect on disability for example there are many companies on the planet that are solely one demographic and are massively successful due to ability"
"@TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @TashmiaI @VirginAtlantic Because the truth is not about diversity but ability... No matter how we place this case the companies with the right talent pool out perform others to provide profit, growth and economic development. Not companies with the right diversity... If you feel differently let's debate"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Pray do tell if my tweets are opinion why are yours based on reports published in mainstream media? Basically what your studies show is that if we hired more female leaders there would be a vast difference? And not that these women had the ability to effect results."
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic So professors, researchers and students who basically were paid to produce study results to secure the tenure and you feel that defines real life innovation comes from a textbook, mind if I ask Bill Gates which textbook he used for Microsoft"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic So innovation by your understanding is a trait, not a thinking? Very limited no?"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Innovation is in thinking not in sex or race... But you seem to be caught in the mainstream narrative aimed at dividing to ensure only those evolved rise to the top."
"@VirginAtlantic In all my 10 years of flying upper class it was only a few weeks ago I was told by a virgin employer on the phone that both my sons should have been collecting airmiles from the age of 2. That＊s about 20 upper class flights to America I＊ve missed on miles!!!!"
"@VirginAtlantic Is it possible to check my eligibility for a refund?"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Also, why does diversity lead you to think that abilities are compromised?"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Good lord no. Not a trait, it＊s a science, and how you stimulate better thinking. Sorry, this isn＊t good use of my time, sorry to have been pulled in ."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic They die eventually and focus on incremental innovation."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic American Banker mag: Companies with predominantly female leaders perform better than those led by men, studies suggest. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows three out of six publicly traded investment funds that specialize in women-run firms are outperforming their benchmarks."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic <U+0001F604>not from mainstream media only, I studied this stuff at masters level"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic It＊s not how we feel but what the literature shows time and again. Yes ability matters but a team with same abilities and no diversity not as innovative as team with ability and diversity."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic There＊s quite a bit of research on this. Modern companies work hard on diversity because there is so much research which points to it being important for innovation leadership. All your tweets are your opinion. Prefer to debate on science"

"@VirginAtlantic @KLM are you airline partners with shared benefits? I think you are but neither seems to know what benefits you share, as a passenger it is very confusing/frustrating to be passed back and forth between you, each of you advising that the other one needs to help <U+0001F937><U+200D>﹥<U+FE0F>"
"@VirginAtlantic I would have thought so too"
"@VirginAtlantic I＊m travelling on a KLM flight tomorrow morning in economy to the US. I am a flying club gold member, am I allowed to check an extra bag for free because of my member status?"
"@VirginAtlantic @KLM You obviously have shared benefits as I can earn miles and tier points, access lounges, get boarding priority and with Delta it＊s very clear that I＊m allowed an extra bag..."
"@VirginAtlantic I contacted them again and they told me to contact you. As partners surely this is agreed between the two airlines and documented as to what the shared benefits are? @KLM maybe it would be beneficial if you and @VirginAtlantic could agree this and get back to me please?"
"@VirginAtlantic Thanks, they told me to contact you...???"
