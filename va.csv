"@Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @TashmiaI @VirginAtlantic Its a good initiative but not necessarily the complete truth, would be nice if it was."
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic And it is this generalistic thinking, misleading media and consistent focus on driving the narrative on the difference between male, female, black, white... Eventually when you see behind the misconstrued narrative it is inevitable that ability drive success, growth &amp; innovation"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Never said that... Diversity or lack thereof should have no effect on disability for example there are many companies on the planet that are solely one demographic and are massively successful due to ability"
"@TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @TashmiaI @VirginAtlantic Because the truth is not about diversity but ability... No matter how we place this case the companies with the right talent pool out perform others to provide profit, growth and economic development. Not companies with the right diversity... If you feel differently let's debate"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Pray do tell if my tweets are opinion why are yours based on reports published in mainstream media? Basically what your studies show is that if we hired more female leaders there would be a vast difference? And not that these women had the ability to effect results."
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic So professors, researchers and students who basically were paid to produce study results to secure the tenure and you feel that defines real life innovation comes from a textbook, mind if I ask Bill Gates which textbook he used for Microsoft"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic So innovation by your understanding is a trait, not a thinking? Very limited no?"
"@TashmiaI @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Innovation is in thinking not in sex or race... But you seem to be caught in the mainstream narrative aimed at dividing to ensure only those evolved rise to the top."
"@VirginAtlantic In all my 10 years of flying upper class it was only a few weeks ago I was told by a virgin employer on the phone that both my sons should have been collecting airmiles from the age of 2. That¡¯s about 20 upper class flights to America I¡¯ve missed on miles!!!!"
"@VirginAtlantic Is it possible to check my eligibility for a refund?"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Also, why does diversity lead you to think that abilities are compromised?"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic Good lord no. Not a trait, it¡¯s a science, and how you stimulate better thinking. Sorry, this isn¡¯t good use of my time, sorry to have been pulled in ."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic They die eventually and focus on incremental innovation."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic American Banker mag: Companies with predominantly female leaders perform better than those led by men, studies suggest. Data compiled by Bloomberg shows three out of six publicly traded investment funds that specialize in women-run firms are outperforming their benchmarks."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic <U+0001F604>not from mainstream media only, I studied this stuff at masters level"
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic It¡¯s not how we feel but what the literature shows time and again. Yes ability matters but a team with same abilities and no diversity not as innovative as team with ability and diversity."
"@JustXavierB @TheeMalebo @Investec @clairemawisa @FaithPopcorn @thando_hopa @MarcSimonKahn @VirginAtlantic There¡¯s quite a bit of research on this. Modern companies work hard on diversity because there is so much research which points to it being important for innovation leadership. All your tweets are your opinion. Prefer to debate on science"

Good that you are swapping to an A350 for our Joburg flight - 25% less fuel consumption.

But you've also completely screwed up our itinerary. It will cost me an extra ¡ê500.

"@VirginAtlantic WHY WHY WHY do you persist in allowing your baggage handlers at Manchester not to follow through with what you advertise. Our bags came off LAST from VS76 upper class, not first. It¡¯s always Manchester that lets you down everywhere else they come off first"
